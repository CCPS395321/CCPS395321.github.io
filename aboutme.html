    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <p> I am working to become a welder. Some experiences that led me here is that the starting yearly income is 90k a year. When I took a field trip to Lorenzo Walker Technical Collage I was shown around a welding facility. Since then I have been doing research and thinking on how I can make my dreams become reality.

I am working towards these goals by watching Youtube videos on how to weld and how to take care of certain cases. A weld is a certain type of trade that has been doing really good the past 15 years. At Lorenzo they can let you be around them while they are preforming. 

The values I consider are my eyes. If I don't wear the proper protection I can lose my eyes. A skill that can lead me into this job is my skill of problem solving. My favorite subject is Science so that has a lot to do with welding because I am making a bond of metals.

Some short term goals I need to accomplish are getting my GED and passing with a good SAT score. Those might sound like a long term but in my eyes they are a short term. I also have to go to Lorenzo Technical High School so I can get a heads start. I should also have at least a 3.0 GPA in order to get into Lorenzo.

The Character traits I want to be most known for is my humor when I'm in the working field. That job is a very serous job and a little laughter can make it go by faster. I want to be known as a hard working person. A achievements I want to get are just making over 120k a year.</p>
